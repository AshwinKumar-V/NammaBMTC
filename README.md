Build Future Cities: 24hr Bangalore Hackathon Project.

**Introduction**
The growing metropolitan population of Bengaluru city depends highly on public transportation for daily commute. This increase in demand has also increased transit management responsibilities and requires 'transparency' in transit availability and movement. Digitization of services has enabled people to track the status and activity of e-commerce deliveries, food deliveries, and cab rides, allowing them to plan and schedule their day accordingly. This also allows the respective service providers to collect user data, analyze users' behaviors and needs and make necessary amends in business models.
The primary aim of the proposed project is to extend Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) services to this level of public transparency and collection of people movement information to help improve decision-making in BMTC management.

**Technological Solution**
The proposed project involves a web application backed by blockchain to let users (commuters) know the availability of BMTC buses on their route, their location, seating availability, and an estimated arrival time that helps them plan their trip. 
From the BMTC operatorsâ€™ perspective, it utilizes people movement information to perform data analysis by running a predictive algorithm that will allow operators to understand the transit traffic through the busiest routes and during peak hours. This will subsequently help BMTC to make better bus schedules and allocate resources accordingly.
